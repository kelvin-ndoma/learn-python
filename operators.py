# operators are symbols which perfom specific mathematical, relational or logical operations
# like addition etc

#  - + *&& / //

x_position = 10

# supposewe want to increment the position of x by x
forward = x_position + 1

# forward contain the initial value of x, on saying x_position + 1 it should print 11
print (forward)
# this will take the stepbackwards
backward = x_position - 1
print (backward)


# the modulo divides and gives the remainder
remainder = 5 % 2
print(remainder)

# floor-division divides discards remainder
floor_division = 5 // 2
print (floor_division)

# exponential raises a number to the power
five_squared = 5 ** 2

print(five_squared)

# try combnaion
# x_position = x_position+1
x_position +=1
