# a step by step coding
# variables creation
# assign a name to the variabe then give it a value

# Numbers

# name = value

x_position = 10 
# here we created a variable name and assigned a value to it
print(x_position)

# reassign a value now to the position of x
x_position = 15
print(x_position)

# note this print the previous value and the latest value


#  float
pi = 3.14
pi = 3.13159

print(pi)

# note we can change the type of x to float by
x_position = 15
print(x_position)

# to now check the type of x_position

print(type(x_position))
